## Installation

### First time?

Further installation instructions provided in the [cairo-lang docs](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/quickstart.html)

Before installing Cairo on your machine, you need to install `gmp`:
```bash
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev # linux
brew install gmp # mac
```
> If you have any troubles installing gmp on your Apple M1 computer, [here’s a list of potential solutions](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22).

For VSCode support:

Download `cairo-0.7.0.vsix` from https://github.com/starkware-libs/cairo-lang/releases/tag/v0.7.0

And run:
```bash
code --install-extension cairo-0.7.0.vsix
```

### Set up the project
Clone the repository


```bash
git clone git@github.com:abigger87/cairomate.git
```

`cd` into it and create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
cd cairomate
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Install the [Nile](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile) dev environment and then run `install` to get [the Cairo language](https://www.cairo-lang.org/docs/quickstart.html), a [local network](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet/), and a [testing framework](https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.2.x/).
```bash
pip3 install cairo-nile
nile install
```

## Usage

### Compile the contracts

```bash
nile compile
```

### Run tests

```bash
pytest
```

Running a specific test file (eg `tests/test_ERC20.py`):
```bash
pytest tests/test_ERC20.py
```

Test a specific test case:
```bash
pytest tests/test_ERC20.py -k 'test_mint'
```


### Extending Cairo contracts

There's no clear contract extensibility pattern for Cairo smart contracts yet. In the meantime the best way to extend our contracts is copypasting and modifying them at your own risk. Remember this contracts are still under development and they have not gone through any audit or security review whatsoever.
